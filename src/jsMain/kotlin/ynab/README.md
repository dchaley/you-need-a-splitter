# Kotlin bindings for YNAB official JavaScript SDK

This should be its own library "soon".

Generated by running dukat on ynab's official javascript SDK. Then a lot of manual hacking at it:

* Need to mark as external.
* Need to remove function bodies üòÆ‚Äçüí®

It seems to be better if I use TS compiler to generate decl files. Requires less hacking but still a bunch. In the
ynab-jdk-js checkout:

```sh
npx tsc --outdir types --emitDeclarationOnly --declaration src/apis/*.ts
npx tsc --outdir types --emitDeclarationOnly --declaration src/models/*.ts
dukat -p ynab -m ynab -d ~/dev/you-need-a-splitter/kotlin/src/jsMain/kotlin/ynab/ types/apis/CategoriesApi.d.ts
```

Hacks:

- have to introduce `@file:JsModule("ynab")` to the top of files when missing
- have to introduce `package ynab` to the top of files when missing
- enums don't get auto-recognized?
- Some `Any` params need to be made nullable `Any?`
- Remove "useless"(?) getter/setter for fields:
  ```
  var type: Any
    get() = definedExternally
    set(value) = definedExternally
  ```
- Move type alias fields to types.kt
- Changed PromiseLike to kotlin js promise in es2015 iterable

I wonder if there's an easier way to generate the type decls we need‚Ä¶
